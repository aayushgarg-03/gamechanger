This is a project which focuses on connecting a mechanic (in range of 5kms )to a person in need.We used basic HTML,CSS & JavaScript for the FrontEnd purpose.We used Google Maps API to give precise location of both Mechanic and Car Owner.In the backend we used Node.js & MongoDB(For Database).We also added a chatting platform for both parties as a more secure way of contacting
